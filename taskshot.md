Functional Requirements Document (FRD) for an Automated Time Tracking Application

1. Overview

1.1 Purpose

This document describes the complete set of functional and non-functional requirements for an automated time tracking application. The system will run unobtrusively in the background on a laptop, periodically capture screenshots, process them using a vision AI model to obtain detailed descriptions, and then feed those descriptions into a large language model (LLM) agent. This agent will infer the user’s current task, log it in a standardized time tracking format, and, when necessary, prompt the user to clarify ambiguous or unknown tasks. The final output will be exportable in formats compatible with standard business time tracking systems (e.g., CSV, XLSX).

1.2 Scope

The application must:
	•	Operate in the background, capturing user activity via screenshots.
	•	Integrate with a vision AI model to analyze screenshots.
	•	Use an LLM-based task classification agent to determine the current task.
	•	Maintain a standard time tracking log in a database (conceptually similar to SQLite).
	•	Prompt the user for input when an ambiguous or unrecognized task is detected.
	•	Provide export functionality for integrating with external time tracking systems.

2. System Overview

2.1 Key Components and Modules
	1.	Background Service Module
	•	Runs continuously in the background.
	•	Triggers periodic screenshot capture.
	2.	Screenshot Capture Module
	•	Captures high-quality screenshots at user-defined intervals.
	•	Ensures minimal impact on system performance.
	•	Respects privacy and resource constraints.
	3.	Vision AI Integration Module
	•	Submits screenshots to a vision AI model.
	•	Receives a detailed textual description of the screen content (e.g., open applications, text, contextual cues).
	•	Handles API communication and error management.
	4.	Task Classification Agent (LLM)
	•	Accepts the textual description from the vision AI.
	•	Matches the description against a pre-defined list of known tasks.
	•	Computes a confidence score for each match.
	•	Decides whether to log a task automatically or prompt the user for clarification.
	5.	User Interaction Module
	•	Provides an unobtrusive prompt when the LLM agent is uncertain.
	•	Displays a suggested task name and allows the user to confirm, modify, or reject it.
	•	Updates the list of known tasks based on user feedback.
	6.	Database Module
	•	Stores task records in a standardized format.
	•	Each record includes:
	•	A unique task identifier.
	•	Start and end timestamps.
	•	Total duration.
	•	Metadata (e.g., confidence scores, screenshot metadata).
	•	Ensures data integrity and supports future scalability.
	7.	Export Module
	•	Allows users to export logged task data.
	•	Supports various formats (CSV, XLSX, etc.) for easy integration with other business systems (e.g., DelTek Vision).

2.2 High-Level Workflow
	1.	Periodic Capture:
	•	The background service triggers the screenshot capture module at configurable intervals.
	2.	Image Analysis:
	•	The captured screenshot is sent to the vision AI model.
	•	The model returns a rich textual description of the screenshot.
	3.	Task Inference:
	•	The LLM-based task classification agent processes the description.
	•	If a high-confidence match is found, the task is logged.
	•	If not, the user is prompted for input.
	4.	Logging and Storage:
	•	Recognized tasks are logged in the database along with relevant timestamps and metadata.
	•	New or ambiguous tasks, once confirmed by the user, are added to the known task list.
	5.	Data Export:
	•	The user can export the logged data in structured formats for further use in business time tracking systems.

7. Detailed AI Coding Assistant Kickoff Prompt

The following is an extensive prompt designed to kickstart the project with an AI coding assistant. It outlines all major components and design considerations in a technology-agnostic manner:

You are tasked with creating an automated time tracking application that runs in the background on a user's laptop. The application must:
- Capture periodic screenshots at configurable intervals.
- Send each screenshot to a vision AI model which returns a detailed textual description of the image. This description should capture contextual details such as open applications, on-screen text, and any other relevant visual cues.
- Pass the textual description to a task classification agent powered by a large language model (LLM). The agent should analyze the description, match it against a pre-defined list of tasks, and determine what task the user is performing.
- Evaluate the confidence of the inferred task:
  - If the confidence is high and the task matches an existing one, log the task automatically.
  - If the confidence is low or the task does not match any known tasks, prompt the user with a suggested task name derived from the analysis. Allow the user to confirm, edit, or provide a new task.
- Log each task entry into a standardized database structure that includes:
  - A unique task identifier.
  - Start and end timestamps.
  - Task duration.
  - Relevant metadata (e.g., AI confidence scores, screenshot metadata).
- Provide an export module that allows users to extract their time tracking data in structured formats (e.g., CSV, XLSX) suitable for integration with business time tracking systems (e.g., DelTek Vision).

Ensure that:
1. The architecture is modular, with clear separation of concerns for screenshot capture, AI integrations (both vision and LLM), user interaction, data logging, and data export.
2. The solution is designed in a technology-agnostic manner, detailing the system flow, data structures, error handling, and integration points without assuming a specific programming language or technology stack.
3. Non-functional requirements are addressed, including performance optimization, data security and privacy, reliability, and scalability.
4. The design supports future improvements, such as enhanced AI models or additional integrations, with minimal modifications to the core system.

Your output should include:
- A high-level architecture diagram (conceptually described).
- Detailed functional requirements for each module.
- Data flow and interaction diagrams.
- A plan for handling user prompts and feedback in ambiguous task scenarios.
- Considerations for export functionality and data compatibility with existing business systems.

This project requires a robust, user-friendly, and secure solution. Provide all necessary design details to allow a smooth transition from design to development.
